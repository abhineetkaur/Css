        <h1>LOVELY</h1>
        <p class="verse1">Thought I found a way<br>
            Thought I found a way out (found)<br>
            But you never go away (never go away)<br>
            So I guess I gotta stay now<br></p>
        <p class="verse2">Oh, I hope some day I'll make it out of here<br>
            Even if it takes all night or a hundred years<br>
            Need a place to hide, but I can't find one near<br>
            Wanna feel alive, outside I can't fight my fear<br>
            Isn't it lovely, all alone?<br></p>
        <p class="verse3">Oh, I hope some day I'll make it out of here<br>
            Even if it takes all night or a hundred years<br>
            Need a place to hide, but I can't find one near<br>
            Wanna feel alive, outside I can't fight my fear<br></p>
        <p class="verse4">Isn't it lovely, all alone?<br>
            Heart made of glass, my mind of stone<br>
            Tear me to pieces, skin to bone<br>
            Hello, welcome home<br></p>
        <p class="verse5">Walkin' out of time<br>
            Lookin' for a better place (lookin' for a better place)<br>
            Something's on my mind (mind)<br>
            Always in my head space<br></p>
        <p class="verse6">But I know some day I'll make it out of here<br>
            Even if it takes all night or a hundred years<br>
            Need a place to hide, but I can't find one near<br>
            Wanna feel alive, outside I can't fight my fear<br>
        </p>
        <p class="verse7">
            Isn't it lovely, all alone?<br>
            Heart made of glass, my mind of stone<br>
            Tear me to pieces, skin to bone<br>
            Hello, welcome home<br>
        </p>
        <p class="verse8">
            Whoa, yeah<br>
            Yeah, ah<br>
            Whoa, whoa<br>
            Hello, welcome home<br>
        </p>
